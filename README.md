# PatternBasedMapGenerator

This is a generic pattern-based map generator, that receives a collection of "patterns" and "cosntraints", and uses a constraint-based search process in order to find a configuration of the input patterns that satisfy the constraints. It was designed to be part of the procedural-content generation (PCG) pipeline of a little personal project. But I decided to separate it into its own project.

(I'm still working on this, since after separating it from the res tof the project, many things need to be re-programmed; updates coming soon)
